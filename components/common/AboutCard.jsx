                I'm a Software Developer, passionate about building
                high-performance, scalable applications. With a foundation in
                Computer Science and hands-on experience in both front-end and
                back-end development, I enjoy tackling complex problems and
                turning ideas into reliable software solutions. My experience
                spans from developing real-time trading platforms to creating
                efficient inventory traceability systems. I'm always eager to
                learn new technologies and contribute to innovative projects.
